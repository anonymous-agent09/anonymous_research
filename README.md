The identification of patents within a specific technological domain is a critical task in the early stages of research and development (R&D) projects. For scientists and researchers, accurately identifying relevant patents maximizes the value of their intellectual property (IP) and helps anticipate potential research and innovation challenges.  For industries, this task is essential, as it allows to gain valuable insights into technological advancements, market competition, and future opportunities for innovation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning (DL) framework for domain-specific patent identification, with a particular focus on the Plasma Physics and cybersecurity domains. Our approach leverages weak supervision to construct a high-quality training dataset by combining multiple noisy labeling sources, including linguistic patterns, domain-specific heuristics, and expert knowledge. We then fine-tune large pre-trained language models on the generated training data, adapting hyperparameters to optimize performance on domain-specific patent classification tasks. We evaluate the models on unseen test data by using common performance metrics and compare the achieved results against an in-context learning approach.
